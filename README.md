The goal of this project was to build out a QR code component and get it to look as close to the given design as possible. I could use any tools to help me complete the challenge. I chose to use vanilla HTML and CSS because that's all I currently know how to use.

To lay things out, I used flexbox. The elements are all one-dimensional so I figured choosing flex over grid would be best. This exercise was pretty simple but I did struggle with sizing because the details are only offered to those with a PRO account, so I had to eyeball everything.
